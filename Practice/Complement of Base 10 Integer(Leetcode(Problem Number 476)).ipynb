    "# Question:\n",
    "    Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as \"101\" in binary, 11 as \"1011\" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of \"101\" in binary is \"010\" in binary.\n",
